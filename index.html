								<p>
									Hi, I am Dawei Zhong. I won my Bachelor of Science degree at <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/abazajian/">Department of Astronomy, Xiamen Universiy</a>.
									I am now taking gap year to develop my understanding of cosmology and dark matter.
								</p>
								<p>
									My current professional interest lie in the cutting-edge of physics and astronomy: Dark Matter. 
									I am working on how to find the astronomical direct evidence (smoking gun) of dark matter. It is expected we will enter the era of dark matter astronomy in the future.
									My undergraduate work mainly focus on hot, highly-ionized circumgalactic medium (with T ~ 10<sup>6</sup>K). 
									Most previous hot CGM observations concentrate on the abundant hot gas (helium-like ion O VII) inside or around the Milky Way. 
									My collaborator and I focus on less frequently studied hot gas called O VIII (with only one electron outside the oxygen nucleus) and investigate its all-sky properties.

								<h3>Dark Matter Astronomy in the Milky Way</h3>
								<h4>Advisor: <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/abazajian/">Prof. Kevork N. Abazajian (UC Irvine)</a></h4>

									In this project, we concentrate on dark matter in the Milky Way, 
									estimating its observables with <a href="https://girder.hub.yt/#collection/5b0427b2e9914800018237da/folder/5b211e42323d120001c7a813">Latte simulation</a>
									 result and discussing how we could find those signals with upcoming X-ray mission. 
									Specifically, we examine the centroid shift (left) and broadening pattern (right) of DM narrow emission features (see the Figure above). 
									We also also consider both DM annihilation and decay processes for photon production. We purpose that a pair observations at symmetry position about the Galactic center 
									could be simple and reliable method for dark matter diagnosis (or make sure whether we've found real dark matter signal). As an example, the Athena X-IFU could identify 
									a separation of the centroid of two dark matter narrow emission (if we could detect them) two times as its energy resolution at l=90 degree and 270 degree, while it would find two lines at the same energy 
									(could not be separated by the telescope) if they are ordinary gas emission.

								<h3>
									XMM-Newton Survey for Local O VIII Absorber
								</h3>
								<h4>
									Advisor: <a href="https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/info/1074/1848.htm">Prof. Taotao Fang (Xiamen University)</a>
								</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/source.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This is the first and most comprehensive study for the O VIII absorption properties inside and around the Milky Way, 
									and help us stand closer to the understanding of hot gaseous corona of galaxies and the solution of the missing Galactic baryon problem.
								</p>
								<p>
									Together with my collaborator <a href="http://219.229.80.128/FangTaoTao/TTF-GROUP/HTML/MEMBERS.html">Zheng Zhou</a>, 
									we conducted an all-sky survey of hydrogen-like O VIII absorber in totally 99 directions (see the Figure above). The temperature of these 
									highly-ionzied gas is about millions degree, and the most abundant component has been greatly studied. In contrast with uniformly distributed O VII, 
									we found most O VIII locates near the Galactic plane. Our result support the disk-concentrated gas distribution model. 
								</p>
								
								<h3>Local Hot Gas Along the H 2356-309 Sight-line</h3>
								<h4>Advisor: <a href="https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/info/1074/1848.htm">Prof. Taotao Fang (Xiamen University)</a></h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/H2356_309.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									We found in the survey project an evidence that indicates the Milky Way has a multiphase hot gas corona. Previous researches believe that the hot gas are iso-thermal 
									(or the temperature is the same everywhere). The H 2356-309 sight-line has a 3.1 sigma O VIII and 1.9 sigma O VII, and the measured temperature is 2.3Ã—10<sup>6</sup> K. This is higher
									than the sight-line of Mkn 421, PKS 2155-304 and 3C 273. Also, base on our calculation result, it challenges the assumption that O VII and O VIII have same spatial distribution,
									and suggested that O VIII has a significant longer path length extending into Galactic halo.
								</p>
								<p>
									Note that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07176">Das et al. (2019)</a> also detect Ne X absorption line along the 1ES 1553+113 sight-line, and it indicates the X-ray absorber
									has two temperatures here (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07176">Das et al. 2019</a>). Since this sight-line is near the Loop I structure while our detection would not 
									on any X-ray structures, our finding would be a much better indicator of pure multiphase CGM.

								<h2>Dark Matter Astronomy in the Milky Way:	</h2>
								<h3>What will the Milky Way looks like and how we could see this</h3>
								<p>Thank you for your interest. Here you could find more details of our research!</p>
								<h3>Outline</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Background</li>
									<li>What dark matter signal would be</li>
									<li>Search for Smoking Guns of Dark Matter</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Background: What you need to know about astronomical searching of dark matter</h3>
								<p>
									Human beings have make several progresses to the understanding of dark matter.
									Scientists have proposed various kinds of particle candidates. 
									They also spare no effort to search the smoking gun for dark matter from both particle physics and astromocial sides. 		
									Currently, particle observers find nothing in ground-based dark matter experiments. 
									In contrast, astronomers contribute a lot in the game. 
									<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2998"> Goodenough & Hooper (2009)</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2752">Hooper & Goodenough (2010)</a>
									discovered that the gamma-ray photon emission from the Galactic center region is stronger than theoretical prediction, which is explained to be the 
									dark matter annihilation signal.
									Besides, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2301">Bulbul et al. (2014)</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4119"> Boyarsky et al. (2014)</a>
									found an unresolved X-ray emission line at 3.5 keV, which is explained as the decay signal of sterile neutrino as dark matter. 
									Since they could be also explained as astrophysical radiation, these findings do not constitute a discovery of dark matter.
									However, we also believe the possibility to find DM direct signals from the sky.
								</p>
								<h3>What dark matter signal would be: inside the Milky Way</h3>
								<p>
									The "dark matter sky", or what the sky would be in dark matter radiation, depends on the properties of dark matter as well as 
									the distribution of dark matter. Since the properties will only add one coefficient before the contribution of dark matter distribution, 
									and since we still have no idea what stuff dark matter really is, we only focus on the structure of dark matter in the Milky Way. We use the 
									dark matter data from the <a href="https://girder.hub.yt/#collection/5b0427b2e9914800018237da/folder/5b211e42323d120001c7a813">Latte simulation</a> and
									estimate the spectrum and flux of dark matter in the Milky Way. The figure below shows the centroid shift (left) and broadening pattern (right) of dark matter spectrum.
									In the left panel, the blue (red) part means the observed dark matter spectrum here is blueshift (redshift) from its original energy. In the right panel, 
									the emission line broadening is small in dark blue part, while the broadening is large in red part. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Web2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									We also consider the annihilation and decay radiation of dark matter. Similarly, we also focus on the contribution of Milky Way structure and 
									present the all-sky result below. The left and right panels are annihilation and decay luminosity maps, respectively. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Web1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Search for Smoking Guns of Dark Matter: From the Energy Shift Pattern</h3>
								<p>
									Even we detect some high-energy photons such as the 3.5 keV line, they could be interpreted as dark matter emission or astrophysical radiation.
									The energy shift of dark matter spectrum will contribute to diagnosis of emission origin. 
									<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04744">Speckhard et al. (2015)</a> suggested that the study of frequency shift of a detected unresolved Galactic 
									line might uncover the origin of the signal. Inside the Milky Way, a dark matter line has different sign of the shift from ordinary gas line due to 
									their distinct velocity distribution. Assuming they are at the same energy in the rest frame, dark matter line would be blueshift (redshift) while 
									the ordinary gas line might be redshift (blueshift) along the same direction. 
									This only occurs at b = 5 degree and l within -40 degree to 40 degree accoring to the paper.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, for the reason of unknown rest frame energy, we still could not decide whether the unresolved emission feature is redshift or blueshift. 
									Besides, one single detection along certain light-of-sight could not rule out the possibility of unidentified extragalactic photon origin.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Web3.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									According to the energy shift comparison of dark matter and the ordinary gas (see the left panel of the figure above), we purpose we could use the
									difference of spectral line center to determine the origin of an mysterious line. Specifically, we focus on the Galactic longitude l=90 degree and l=270 degree
									(or -90 degree). If we could detect two unresolved lines at these two observations with Athena X-IFU, we could find the dark matter line would be separated two times 
									as the energy resolution of the telescope. This would not happen for the ordinary gas emission feature. That is, if Athena detects two lines at two directions and they're separated,
									these line is very likely to be originated from the dark matter.
